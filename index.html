            Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and
            Marta Kauffman which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6,
            2004, lasting ten seasons.[1] With an ensemble cast starring
            Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew
            Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in
            their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The series
            was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association
            with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were
            Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane. Kauffman and Crane began
            developing Friends under the working title Insomnia Cafe between
            November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and
            together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC.
            After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes
            to Six of One[2] and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named
            Friends.[3] Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank,
            California. The show ranked within the top ten of the final
            television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot
            in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and
            was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the
            fifth-most-watched series finale in television history[4][5][6] and
            the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.[7][8] Friends
            received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most
            popular television shows of all time.[9] The series was nominated
            for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series
            award in 2002[10] for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on
            TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[11] and no. 5 on Empire
            magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[12] In 1997, the
            episode "The One with the Prom Video" was ranked no. 100 on TV
            Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[13] In 2013, Friends
            ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV
            Series of All Time,[14] and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series
            of All Time.[15] The sitcom's cast members returned for a reunion
            special aired on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.
